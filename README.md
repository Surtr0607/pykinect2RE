# pykinect2RE
=========================

The **Python Kinect version 2 REMASTERED** (pykinect2RE) is a Python 3 package that allows you to extract the data you want from Microsoft extended event files (.xef) generated from the Microsoft Kinect V2, and even from a live stream of data. The package also comes with modules that allow you to play the captured data back, and plot the data on graphs using matplot. This library package is based on the pykinect2.
